contribute
------------

We're so glad you're interested in helping make rovercode even better! Whether you've got years of experience or you're pretty new to coding, you can make great contributions, and we are here to help and support you.

You can get in touch with the folks at rovercode in lots of ways:

- Pop into `our chatroom <http://chat.rovercode.com>`_.

- Add a comment to the ticket you're working on.

- Email developers@rovercode.com .

And if you ever need to, we'd be happy to set up a time to video chat and screen-share!

What is rovercode?
====================
rovercode is an open-source educational robotics platform. Create code that listens to the rover's sensors and controls its motors, then watch your code in action as the rover sets out across your classroom! We enable students to hit the ground coding.

How to Get Started
=====================
- Join `our chat <http://chat.rovercode.com>`_ and say hello in any of the rooms!

- Find a feature ticket that you'd be exited to work on. There are two pieces of rovercode, and therefore two collections of tickets: `rovercode-web <https://github.com/rovercode/rovercode/issues>`_ (our website with the Blockly web app) and `rovercode <https://github.com/rovercode/rovercode/issues>`_ (the code that runs on the rover hardware to control the motors and whatnot).

- Get set up by following the READMEs on `rovercode-web <https://github.com/rovercode/rovercode-web/blob/development/README.md>`_ or `rovercode <https://github.com/rovercode/rovercode/blob/development/README.md>`_. We work hard to make setup super easy, but remember to `reach out <http://chat.rovercode.com>`_ if you have any issues!

- Create a branch off the development branch called something like <ISSUE_NUMBER>-some-cool-feature.

- Make your changes and commit them!

- `Make a pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ of your branch against development.

If you are new to using GitHub to collaborate, they have `a nice guide <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_ to get the basic idea of it.

Coding Standard
=================
We use Python's `PEP8 coding standard <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. The READMEs have instructions for running a style-checker (prospector) that will tell you if you have any style issues. If you can't seem to make it happy, just make your pull request anyway, and we'll help you get it straightened out!

Code of Conduct
=================
We expect all interactions related to rovercode to meet our `code of conduct <https://github.com/rovercode/rovercode-web/blob/development/docs/code_of_conduct.rst>`_. Please report any violations by emailing brady@rovercode.com .
